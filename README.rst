The Land Variational Ensemble Data Assimilation fRamework (LaVEnDAR) implements the method of Four-Dimensional
Ensemble Variational data assimilation for land surface models. In this README we show an example of implementing
4DEnVar with the JULES land surface model.

Project overview
----------------

The data assimilation routines and minimization are included in :code:`fourdenvar.py`. For the example included in this
project you will require an installation of the JULES land surface model (more information on JULES can be found here:
https://jules.jchmr.org/ ). Model specific routines for running JULES are found in :code:`jules.py` and
:code:`run_jules.py`. The data assimilation experiment is setup in :code:`experiment_setup.py` with variables set for
output directories, model parameters, ensemble size and functions to extract observations for assimilation. The module
:code:`run_experiment.py` runs the ensemble of model runs and executes the experiment as defined by
:code:`experiment_setup.py`. Some experiment specific plotting routines are also included in :code:`plot.py`.

Data for running the JULES model can be found in the :code:`data/` directory, including driving data for the Mead maize
FLUXNET site, a JULES dump file and a JULES land fraction file. There are 2 JULES namelist file directories
:code:`example_nml` and :code:`williams_nml`. The :code:`example_nml` directory is used for JULES runs in the example
experiment included in the tutorial. The :code:`williams_nml` directory was used to produce a "model truth" JULES run
from which pseudo observations are sampled in the tutorial example. Output from the different JULES model runs are
stored in the various subdirectories under the :code:`output/` directory.

experiment_setup.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module controls how the experiment will be run. Output and namelist directories are set by :code:`output_directory`
and :code:`nml_directory`. The model executable path is set by :code:`model_exe`. The functions to exatract the mean
prior model estimate to the assimilated observations, the ensemble of prior estimates to the observations and the
assimilated observations are set by :code:`jules_hxb`, :code:`jules_hxb_ens` and :code:`obs_fn` respectively. These
functions are defined in the :code:`observations.py` module and are experiment and model specific.

The parameters to be optimised in the experiment are set in the dictionary :code:`opt_params`, in the tutorial
experiment the dictionary is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    opt_params = {'pft_params': {
                      'jules_pftparm': {
                          'neff_io': [7, 6.24155040e-04, (5e-05, 0.0015)],
                          'alpha_io': [7, 6.73249126e-02, (0, 1.0)],
                          'fd_io': [7, 8.66181324e-03, (0.0001, 0.1)]}},
                  'crop_params': {
                      'jules_cropparm': {
                          'gamma_io': [2, 2.07047321e+01, (0.0, 40.0)],
                          'delta_io': [2, -2.97701647e-01, (-2.0, 0.0)],
                          'mu_io': [2, 2.37351160e-02, (0.0, 1.0)],
                          'nu_io': [2, 4.16006288e+00, (0.0, 20.0)]}}}

where each heading in the :code:`opt_params` dictionary corresponds to a JULES namelist filename and contains another
dictionary for the JULES namelists defined within that file. Each namelist heading contains a dictionary of the
parameters to change within the namelist. The parameters hold a list of size 3 containing the index of
the parameter to be optimised, the prior value to use for the parameter and the bounds (low, high) for the parameter.
For example if we want to optimise the value of nitrogen use efficiency (:code:`neff_io`) for maize in JULES we have to
first specify the filename where this parameter appears :code:`pft_params`. Then in the dictionary below
:code:`pft_params` specify the namelist where the parameter appears :code:`jules_pftparm`. Then in the dictionary below
:code:`jules_pftparm` specify :code:`neff_io` with a list of the maize plant functional type index, its prior value and
its bounds.

We specify the error set on the prior parameters with :code:`prior_err`, the ensemble size with
:code:`ensemble_size`, the number of processors to use for the experiment with :code:`num_processes` and the seed value
for any random perturbations performed in the experiment with :code:`seed_value`. We also set a function to save
plotting output from the data assimilation experiments with :code:`save_plots` and a save directory with
:code:`plot_output_dir`.

Tutorial
--------

In this tutorial we run a twin experiment to recover 7 JULES model parameters from a known model truth. The tutorial
focuses on the maize plant functional type within JULES-crop. We assimilate observations of for leaf area index, gross
primary productivity and canopy height sampled from a "model truth". These are similar to the observations we expect to
have for real site level data. The functions used to extract these observations and the JULES modelled estimate to these
observations are included in :code:`observations.py`. The rest of the setup can be seen within
:code:`experiment_setup.py`.

.. note::

    To run this tutorial you must have a version of JULES installed on your system. The path to the executable for your
    version of JULES must be included in the :code:`model_exe` variable in :code:`experiment_setup.py`.

Running data assimilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the variables in :code:`experiment_setup.py` have been set it is possible to run the default data assimilation
experiment by moving into the :code:`lavendar/` directory and running the command:

.. code-block:: unix

    python run_experiment.py run_xb run_xa plot

This will run the full example data assimilation experiment, with the :code:`run_xb` argument running the prior mean
JULES model, :code:`run_xa` running the analysis ensemble after the data assimilation has been performed and
:code:`plot` saving plotting output from the :code:`save_plots` function in :code:`experiment_setup.py`.

Plotting
^^^^^^^^

Below we include the example plotting output from the tutorial exercise. For the first 4 plots below the Blue shading is
the prior ensemble spread (+/- 1 standard deviation), the orange shading is the posterior ensemble spread
(+/- 1 standard deviation), the pink dots are observations with error bars and the dashed black line is the model truth.
For all variables (including unobserved harvestable material) we can see we are much closer to the truth with the
posterior estimate after data assimilation. Prior and posterior distributions for the 7 optimised parameters are shown
in the final plot where light grey is the prior distribution, dark grey is the posterior distribution and the black
dashed line is the model truth value. We can see that for this experiment all model parameters shift towards the model
truth, except for the scale factor for dark respiration (:code:`fd_io`). This is due to the fact that the
assimilated observations are not giving any constraint on the dark respiration of the plant as all observations are
averaged daily and we only have gross primary productivity and not net primary productivity. The parameters being
optimised in this experiment can be changed in the :code:`opt_params` dictionary in :code:`experiment_setup.py`, make
sure the index set in the :code:`opt_params` dictionary is for the the plant functional type that is being observed.
